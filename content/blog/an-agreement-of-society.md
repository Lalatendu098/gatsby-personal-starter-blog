  IS EDUCATED"'

\    Before stepping into the field of education let’s dive into the demographic structure of India . The young India, having a population of well passed 1.3 billion, now entering the world with better confidence with its human resources. When the rest of the world is aging , we are having an influential working age with 65% of total population below the age of 35 and a 50% of the representatives under the age of 25. When the rest of the world is declining with their under graduates we are having a surplus (225millon) paving their way to enter into higher education .

\    Now the average age of India is 28 years while Japan has an average age of 47 , China – well passed 40, the Youthful USA -40, Europe -46 .So evidentially we are a youthful, productive and dynamic country that can transform the world to a safe heaven. The game that China had played in last decades, can be ours now. According to the ILO in the next 2-3 years there will be around 120 million population in India in between the age group of 20-24 while china will have only 90 million and the USA will be handling a shortage of 20-30 million of these youth faces. So ……

\    Yes we have people but do we have the ability to equip the people to take the advantage of this demography , to be the work engine of the world. If we follow the right track, it will give a boost to the society as well as economy at the bigger picture and can enhance the productivity of the world, but if we do a bit wrong the demographic dividend will be a demographic disaster. When the unemployed ,uneducated ,frustrated young population will be handed over with a gun to trigger against the country , just imagine the catastrophe . So education is not just a social and economic issue , it is a matter of national security. So we have to equip them to take the opportunities going to be offered by the 21st century.

Let's take an approach to define education with the basis of 4 **E**s –

\    1St of this kind is EXPANSION . Notably we have done pretty much well in this 1st E (Expansion).When the British left us , we had a literacy rate of 16%. Total count of universities was around 25 and we just had something around 5000 colleges with approximately 6 lakh students. But now if we count ,we have 789 universities , 37,204 colleges with around 20 million students at higher education. So the development regarding the expansion is appreciating but much more needs to be done. (Solution Part)

\    The 2nd **E** leads to EQUITY . Here equity means social and educational inclusion. Including the excluded under the ambit of education, reach to the un-reach privileged sections of the society. Of course gender here plays an immense roll . When the sun of British empire sat in India (1947) we had around 5-6% literacy rate among women that means 1 out of 16-17 women could read and write. Yes we have climbed a long way to 65.46% but still one out of three women cannot read and write. Social barriers like caste, region, religion etc. are standing like unbreakable walls, and to address this we need to 1st increase the literacy rate among the old aged population. Social awareness campaigns need to be promoted , Financial literacy should be a triumph to be achieved  etc.  And these steps will lead to my 3rd **E** that is EXCELLENCE .

\    Here the EXCELLENCE talks about the quality of education. Of course qualitative institutions are there like IITs, IIMs etc. but think about these institutions where the majority of students are enrolled. Average Indian institutions are not providing that much of quality. A very good Chinese proverb states

 **“If you are thinking a year ahead, plant a seed.**

**If you are planning a decade ahead plant a tree**

**But if you are planning a century ahead Educate the People ”** 

Here education means quality education that will enrich your century. That leads me to my final **E** .

\    EMPLOYABILITY – Often you will go through these kind of news that some CEOs are complaining about their graduate employees. They are not satisfied with their quality of education rather they are investing money to fill up the educational gaps by various courses and these courses are not meant for their training purposes. That’s why they are reluctant to hire freshers at a large scale and try to keep experienced players with a huge amount of sum by decreasing their profitability.

\    So in a nutshell, the educational gap is hampering our economic as well as social security. State universities are under financed and hampering quality of education. So there is a need for the infusion of central as well as state funds by allocating the maximum amount of budget to the education . Early education to children is the need of the hour. Gender gap needs to be addressed .we have to make sure that adult literacy rate is increasing by streamlining the dropouts by taking Gross Enrollment Ratio (total enrollment within a country in a specific level of education, regardless of age) to a certain benchmark. Vocational Training should be encouraged and the most important thing is to ensure the promotion of research and innovation.

\    The Good news is, about 95% of our 12y/o population can read and write , so the future looks good and if we look at the above pieces carefully , we can say to the rest of the World “WE ARE COMING ”.

\    Thanks for your patience . Hope it wasn't boring (I could've used some emojis, but sorry I actually don't know how to put it . May be next time )

\    See you in the next one.
