In Economy – “ It absolutely matters how much you are investing by looking a decade ahead , but it is also inevitable to look at what you have “ – Lalatendu (ha ha)

Let’s talk about some absolute problems related to Indian Economy.

Well , before that I have to through some light on some concepts

\    Repo Rate – If a bank has to avail money from RBI, it has to park some securities (G-Sec) there with a promise to repurchase it. The rate at which a bank repurchases its securities from RBI is called as REPO RATE. Or simply you can say that at which rate bank borrow money from RBI.

\    You must be aware of the Prime Minister’s 5T economy vision. Even to achieve this by 2025 we will be needing a steady growth of atleast 10% of GDP year on year. In today’s scenario it seems quite difficult. But government is trying to have a substantial impact on growth by infusing money to banking sector, taking policy measures to boost investments in infrastructure. In a nutshell if I’d say , its taking various measures to first revive the economy and then to have a steady growth. These are the facts which I think are known to all. Let me talk about the other part of the coin – Monetary policy transmission.

\    An economy, having a worth of around 3T is expected to expand periodically if fruit full regulations are implemented. As we know GDP of a country is directly proportional to the banking habits of people and we have 1.35 billion of population, then what do you think , aren’t our banking habits strong enough to generate more money? Yes!! Certainly. There is a policy transmission gap in the economy. Let’s talk about the reasons one by one  for poor monetary transmission .

\    The main reason being “Banks are over-dependent on deposits”. Banks rely more on public deposits with them for circulating money as loans. If the banks had been more dependent on RBI for raising money, the situation would’ve entirely different. Because when the banks will depend on RBI for money to circulate as loans then the Immediate effect of policy rates (Repo, Reverse Repo) will be there in the economy. How ? Okay let me explain. RBI decreases its repo rate when there is less money in the market. But when RBI does this, banks are reluctant to cut their lending rates. The main reason for that is banks are having surplus amount of cash through their deposits (Time, Demand) and they can easily forward this money as loans without any rate cut. But when RBI increases the rate in case of a bit inflation ,the increase of rate will be quite visible in the market.

\    Next reason on the line is- Deposits with higher maturity. Banks mainly have their deposits as time deposits (50% +) with a maturity period more than a year and these deposits come with a fixed rate not with a floating one. That means what may be the policy rate in the market , they have to offer an equal amount of interest rate. So by decreasing the lending rate ,banks will incur a loss.

\    Now, the government is operating a number of small saving schemes, e.g. PPF (Public Provident Fund),National Saving Certificate etc.. The interest rates on these schemes is usually higher than the rate that is provided by banks to its depositors. So people invest more on these schemes because of the cost benefit analysis.

\    The higher NPAs (Non Performing Assets) of the banks accompanied by higher provisioning requirements would reduce the ability of the bank to offer money as loans, that to with a lower interest rate.

\    There were also some flaws at the monetary policy calculating tools like -Base rates and MCLR (Marginal cost of lending rate) . But now RBI has come up with a new method of calculating the rates for banks i.e External benchmarking of loans, which is somewhat better than the previous methods.

\    These are some hurdles on the path of better realization of monetary policy in India. So what can be done?

\    If we look at a developed country, let’s say USA for this matter- The people there ,they save less and consume more. What happens is –

* There is less money inside their banks (to be used by banks as loanable funds).
* Better realization of money in the economy as they spend more. So money multiplier effect will be much higher and the GDP will boost.
* So , now bank has to be dependent on central bank and other institutions for borrowing. And hence when there will be a policy cut or hike by the central bank , that will be clearly visible in the economy.

\    So in India, it is clearly visible that there is a lack of financial literacy among us. As we know the velocity of money is always grater when it is in the hands of poor and less at elite class population. So we need to take measures to increase the efficiency of money with public hands by making them aware of finance. Here cooperative federalism can do the most. The govt. (centre and state) should intervene and incentivize students like BBA, MBA to have their internship under a DM (Dist. Magistrate) at grass root level to literate people on finance . The govt. can also open some institutes to train other students and give them an appointment under DMs to make the goal easier. It will concomitantly boost the employment generation at dist. Level. Govt. can introduce a practical subject on finance at higher secondary level to make its own people literate. Okay , what are the fruits, that will be available after planting the tree called “Financial literacy”.

* People will learn not to save much and by doing so they can realize the benefit of health and education.
* After getting literate they can start investing on shares/bonds at share market , and the impact of that could be a financial revolution in India.
* Money inside their bank accounts will come down as they start consuming more and that will lead to -the banks depending on RBI to have loanable funds at their disposal. A better policy transmission can be acquired.
* When banks only can get their money from external sources , their profitability will decrease so they will start paying less interest to their demand and time depositors . By doing so they will incentivize people to not to put money in bank accounts (As profit margin is significantly less).
* Now people have more money in their hands , they can buy more share/bonds. They can consume more.

\    So to make our country great , 1st we have to make our people educated. According to Robert Kyosaki –

**“ Intelligence solves problems and amp;**

**Produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone”**
