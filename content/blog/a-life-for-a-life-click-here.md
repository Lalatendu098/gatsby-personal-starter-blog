**“ Life is no brief candle for me. it is a sort of splendid torch,**

**which I have got hold of for the moment, and want to**

**make it burn as brightly as possible before handling it on to**

**the future generation ‘’ – Geoge Shaw**



\    There was a child- underprivileged, undernourished but was living a life with great vision. A vision of true love for the society, a vision to be a protector of it’s laws. Just think about that, the society which has made him to roam around for a piece of bread and a carpet which will make him and his family to spend their night with a bit ease, he is dreaming to keep that society better. Every time when he dreams about having a book in his hands, he just have to carry a bag of garbage to earn that bread. They don’t have a voter card that is why they are beyond the purview of the so called regional politics. They are afraid of spending the whole pocket in giving bribery, so they are deprived of social benefits. Just think once, while you are having a spicy butter chicken on your table, are they having a piece of dry bread at-least . Yes, it is not your fault, but it is also not their fault as well. But remember one thing, they exist. The govt. can do nothing, if we don’t put our hands together. Yes!! We surely can do the miracle, but together.

\    I always say – the most selfish thing you can do is to help others. And why selfish? The inner pleasure you’ll get by this is incomparable. So try your best to achieve whatever you want. Always keep the god first and serve your best. After achieving your goal, come back and take one from the deep starvation. Believe me, that day your life will be worth living . And if you could teach a woman, then that will be your biggest achievement ever. Because as the quote goes on to say “ What sunshine is to flowers, girls are to the humanity…”. You have one single life. Try to take most out of it. Be kind and polite to others. Remember – giving respect is your character not anyone else’s. Everyday while going to bed just thank the god for choosing you to perform the best character.
