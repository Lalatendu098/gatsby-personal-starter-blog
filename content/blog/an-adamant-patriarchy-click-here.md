description: "everyday it's  WOMEN'S DAY "
---


Women like Savitribai Phule (in early 19th century) who was an illiterate girl while got married to Jyotirao Phule , later regarded as the first official female teacher and the mother of feminism in India also backstabbed by some stereotype people believing in a male dominated society .Thanks to her husband who made her a revolutionary character against the so called society and kept her going to achieve the triumph. They together built 3 schools, only meant for girl Childs and with passage of time the girls outnumbered the boys in that locality.

In today’s society no doubt there are such persons resembling Jyotirao Phule, but we shouldn’t underestimate the evils as well. The recent judgment of the SC while acquitting Priya Ramani from the charge of defamation, by accentuating that “the Right to reputation cannot be protected against women’s right to dignity” marked a landmark judgment. But the thing is that it shouldn’t have happened at the first place. Why are we objectifying women? Why we just assume them as our possessions? Shouldn’t we change this attitudes towards them?

I can remember a recent statement by an honorable SC judge , saying “How can you define it as rape when two members of a society live as husband and wife, how brutal the husband may be”. That statement was unjust. When the protector of people acts as the perpetrator what can we expect from normal people as you and me.

“ Yatra Naryasthu Pujyante, Ramanti Tatra Devata” which literally means “ God Live In Places Where Women Are Worshipped” . Women are at the forefront of our nation. We should encourage them to lead us for a bright future. Some governments are trying to incentivize women for their household works or can I say that they are doing so for the sake of their vote banks. Could you imagine the consequence of these moves. Let me give you an idea. Firstly they will curb the potentials of the women, their freedom will be restricted. Contributions of women to GDP (17%) against global average (40%) will further be downgraded. It will further lead us to a patriarchal society where parents of a girl will be reluctant for her further education as she will be earning for her housework at in-law’s and the list goes on… 

Finally to conclude let me elucidate certain things. Everyone tries to get some attention as a hero. Be a hero as Jyotirao Phule .You can certainly be a hero to your daughter, to your mother, to your wife,to your friend and indeed to yourself. A true man never disrespects a women. 

{ A very small article, keeping your patience in mind. Actually issues against women cann't be described at a single go. One thing - lets change the frame of our glasses and make the world a better place.}
